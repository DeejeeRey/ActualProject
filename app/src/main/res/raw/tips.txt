Stay organised! A clear desk is a clear mind.
Split large tasks into smaller, more achievable ones.
Take regular breaks!
Remove distractions (this is what I'm here for)
Reward yourself regularly - you're doing great!
Write your to-do list!
Set yourself deadlines to keep yourself on track.
Find yourself a work buddy!
Compete against your friends in the leader board!
You've got this!
Keep on going!
Start off with your hardest task of the day - the rest will seem easy.
